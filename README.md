# OpenHackMicrosoft

This repository aims at gathering resources, coding and informations from the Open Hack event (5-7/11/2018).
The challenges were mainly focused on image recognition and eventually on detection object recognition.

The structure of the folder is the following:
- **Data** ==> all images of the company (each subfolder corresponds to an item category)
- **Output**: ==> saved models
- **Scripts**: ==> code in Python 3
